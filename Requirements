NewBank Software App – Group 15 Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

Overview:
NewBank is an idea for a new disrupter bank where customers can interact with their accounts via a simple command-line interface. The originator of this idea has produced some basic client-server code as well as a protocol for sending commands and receiving responses from the NewBank server. The originator of the idea has asked your group to further develop their base code - specifically, implementing the protocol. However, the originator is also keen for input and your team can alter or add to the protocol to improve interaction with the NewBank server as well as to add new services. For example, the originator is keen for NewBank customers to be able to offer micro-loans to other NewBank customers in a micro-loan marketplace. You and a team of developers have taken up this challenge. Your team have access to the originators basic client-server code as well as the protocol for sending commands and receiving responses from the NewBank server. The originator has said that your group can add to, remove and/or alter any part of this basic code as well as the proposed protocol. Their only requirement is that customers have to interact via a command-line interface and that any changes/additions to the protocol are fully documented.
